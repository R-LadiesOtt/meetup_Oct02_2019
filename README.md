# Meetup October 02,2019

In this meetup, members will get hands-on experience with a mini-coding session! 

For this event, we will be using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/nhis_2017_data_release.htm) to demonstrate how to analyze "real" data. The data we're required to use in our day-to-day work are often messy, hard to read, and may contain missing values. The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate how to overcome these difficulties in order to find meaningful relationships in the data.

We have included in this repository a basic R code to load this data into R. This is not a mandatory step for everyone to take, there are other ways of loading these data, this is just intented to help people get started.

First, you will need to download the data from the website. To run the code LoadData.R, you will need to download the csv household file, as shown in the picture below.
